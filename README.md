# wiiu_usb-controller_config
Config for the Wii U Homebrew App HID to VPAD

Works with a cheap Controller with an USB dongle

May or may not work with your controller, but worked for two of mine.

Configured after [this tutorial](https://github.com/Maschell/controller_patcher/wiki/5.d-Controller-%7C-Adding-new-devices)
